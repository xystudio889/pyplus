def joseph_problem(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Joseph problem is a classic problem in computer science. It is a problem of finding the last person standing in a circle of people. The problem is named after the Greek mathematician Josephus. The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm called the Josephus problem. The algorithm works as follows:

    1. Start with a list of n people numbered from 1 to n.
    2. Start with a pointer to the first person in the list.
    3. Remove the person pointed to by the pointer.
    4. Move the pointer n-1 positions ahead in the list.
    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there is only one person left in the list.
    6. The last person remaining in the list is the last person standing in the circle.

    The Josephus problem is a classic example of a mathematical problem that can be solved using a simple algorithm. The algorithm is simple and easy to understand, but it can be improved by using more advanced techniques such as dynamic programming or memoization.
    Args:
        n (int): The number of people in the circle.
    Returns:
        int: The number of the last person standing in the circle.
